The problem requires us to send a GET request every 1 second to retrieve users details from a random API. The retrieved data should be appended to a file named "users.csv". The provided code for this problem is available in the file "ass1.py". The output, "users.csv", displays the fetched data from the random API, with each column separated by commas as it is a CSV file.

## Assignment-1-(A)

The problem requires us to read the "users.csv" file and sort the data based on the first name of the users. The sorted data should be stored in a new CSV file named "users-sorted.csv". The code for this problem is provided in the "ass2.py" file. The output, "users-sorted.csv", displays the sorted data of users with each column separated by commas as it is a CSV file.

## Assignment-1-(B)

The problem requires us to write a program that takes an ID number as input and searches for the corresponding record in the "users.csv" file. The program should output the matched user's full description. The code for this problem is provided in the "ass3.py" file. The output, which shows the resulting matched value and description of the user, is displayed here.

## How to run the code?

This programs can be run in any IDE online (Google Colabs) as well as offline (VS Code).

* Steps to run program in Google Colabs:
1. Open Google Colab: Go to the Google Colab website (https://colab.research.google.com/) and open a new notebook.
2. Upload the Python file: In the Colab notebook, click on the "File" menu, then select "Upload notebook" to upload your Python file (.py). 
3. Run the Python file: Once the Python file is uploaded, you can execute it by running the code in a cell. You can execute the code cell by clicking the play button on the left side of the cell or by pressing Shift+Enter.
4. View the output: The output of your Python file will be displayed directly below the code cell.

* Steps to run program in VS Code:
1. Install the Python extension: Make sure you have the Python extension installed in your VS Code.
2. Open the Python file: Open the Python file you want to run in VS Code by either clicking on it in the File Explorer.
3. Select the Python interpreter: At the bottom-left corner of the VS Code window, click on the Python interpreter version. 
4. Run the Python file: Once you have the Python file open and the interpreter selected, you can run it by either:
i. Clicking the "Run" button in the top menu bar ii. Typing python filename.py in the terminal
5. View the output: The output of your Python file will be displayed in the integrated Terminal within VS Code.
